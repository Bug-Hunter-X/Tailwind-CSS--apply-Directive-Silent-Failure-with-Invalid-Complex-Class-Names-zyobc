The solution involves carefully reviewing and validating the class names used within the `@apply` directive.  Ensure that every class name exists and is correctly spelled.   Use your IDE's autocompletion features to help prevent typos.  For example, if you have the following incorrect `@apply` statement:

```css
@apply bg-gray-200 p-4 text-lg invalid-class;
```

And `invalid-class` is not defined, remove it or correct it to a valid class name.

```css
@apply bg-gray-200 p-4 text-lg;
```

This corrected version will apply the styles correctly.
