This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a complex class name that contains multiple classes or pseudo-classes separated by spaces.  The issue arises when one of those classes within the `@apply` directive is invalid or doesn't exist in your Tailwind CSS configuration.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior where the `@apply` directive silently fails, and the intended styles are not applied.
